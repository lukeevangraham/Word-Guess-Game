Deployed at:  https://lukeevangraham.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

In this activity, I created a vanilla JavaScript based word guessing game. I also used Bootstrap for the visual layout.

## Using the app
This James Bond themed game tests your familiarity with all things 007.  See if you can guess the word.

Press any key to begin guessing letters in the word.

If the word is oddjob, it displays like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, it reveals them: o d d _ o  _.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game automatically chooses another word and invites the user to play again.
